Write me a server-client application with the following requirements and features: 

- The server-client communicate will be established via a TCP network socket.

Server Application - it must be written in Electron that has a GUI interface. After launching the application a Window should be displayed with the following layout : 

[text field for port number input] [Start Listening button] [Stop Listening button]

a Table displaying connected TCP clients with the following column fields : 

Hostname, Username, Ip Address, Os Type.

The user ont he electron desktop application should be able to select a connected client from the table, two options should be displayed:

Execute Command

This should open up a new Window called Execute Command with the following layout:

--Execute Command--

[text field to input system Command] [Execute Button]

--Display Results Window--

Results of the Commands Executed on the connected client will be displayed here the window should be scrollable


--------------------------------

[ Close button ]

Exit:
this should terminate all the connected client tcp connection gracefully.

Client application - the client application should be written in node js and it will take in two arguments, an ip Address and aa port number to connect to.

eg: client.js 10.221.33.1 8443

the client will submit the necessary data to the server to populate itself on the connected client
